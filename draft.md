This is a video game.

# Overview
In this game, the player is an asteroid, drifting trough space and there are other celestial bodies in there. Their goal is to get bigger by consuming the other bodies that are smaller than him. If the player hits a body smaller, the body breaks and the player consumes the mass. If the player hits a body bigger, the player is destroied.

# Body mass logic
The mass of the celetial bodies should be a round number, like "1". The player starts with 5 and there should be a random number of other celestial bodies varing between masses.

# Win the game
The player wins the game when it's mass becomes "100".
